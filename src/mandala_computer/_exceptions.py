class ConflictError(APIError):
    """The request was fine; the moment was not (409).

    Every one of these clears itself without anybody doing anything, so the
    answer is to wait and try again rather than to change the request. It means
    something is in flight that this operation cannot run alongside:

    - the computer's disk is still being copied from a snapshot or another
      computer (see :meth:`Computer.wait_until_built`)
    - a snapshot of it is being taken, or one is already being taken
    - it is already being deleted
    - a snapshot being deleted is one another is chaining onto
    - a purge was confirmed against a set of snapshots that has since changed
    - the guest agent has not answered yet, in the first seconds of a start —
      so retrying is the remedy, and giving up here abandons a machine that was
      about to answer
    - another operation is holding that computer's guest agent
    - a restart was asked of a computer with a suspended session, or a suspend
      of one that is not running
    - something is driving the guest at the moment a suspend was asked for, or
      a suspend has committed to the computer a request just arrived for — the
      retry resumes it, which is what the caller wanted

    Distinct from :class:`PlanLimitError`, which will not clear on its own, and
    from a plain :class:`APIError`, which usually will not either. A guest agent
    that stays silent past its boot window stops being a conflict and becomes a
    502 :class:`APIError`, so a retry loop on this exception terminates rather
    than being told "still booting" forever.
